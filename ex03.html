        OMG! After reading A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson, I realized how like humans are. Read what he
        wrote in his book:
        
        So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that they assemble in such a willing manner is only
        part of what got you here. To be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and smart enough to know it, you also had
        to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of biological good fortune. Survival on Earth is a surprisingly tricky
        business. Of the billions and billions of species of living thing that have existed since the dawn of time, most-99.99
        percent-are no longer around. Life on Earth, you see, is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature
        of our existence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life but even better at extinguishing it.
        
        Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favored evolutionary line, but you have
        also been extremely-make that miraculously-fortunate in your personal ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion
        years, a period of time older than the Earth's mountains and rivers and oceans, every one of your forebears on both
        sides has been attractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and
        circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned,
        starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny
        charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of
        hereditary combinations that could result-eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly-in you.
